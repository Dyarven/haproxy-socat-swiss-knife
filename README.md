A tool to interact with the HAProxy socket using [socat](https://www.kali.org/tools/socat/) to make frontend and server/backend state changes, view stick-tables, force healthchecks, track health check results, control network traffic and requests and other stuff more easily.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Interactive and preset mode**: Includes a workaround to support interactive mode in Debian based systems using netcat and socat readline in RHEL based ones.
- **Fast and simple:** Interactive menu with predefined and parsed complex commands to diagnose problems quickly.
- **Self descriptive:** Pretty much run and gun.
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Ensures minimal resource usage for smooth performance.
- **Native:** Fully made in bash with native tools.

## âš¡Requirements
- Requires socat package and a running haproxy with the stats socket configured with admin permissions (duh)
- Note that my functions assume that your HAProxy configuration doesn't have stick table IDs specified, so they share the backend name.

### Run the Script
```bash
# run as sudo (some commands require root to make changes)
bash haproxy_socat_swiss_knife.sh
```

### Install as a program
```bash
# Copy the script in /usr/local/bin as "hssk" and ensure proper permissions.
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hssk
#Now you can run it from anywhere simply typing:
hssk
```
